# Surfs_up

## Overview of the analysis: 
I want to open a surf shop and ice cream in Hawaii and I've found a possible investor but before he's willing to cement the deal he wants more information about the temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results: 

+ Based on my findings Oahu maintains consistent average temperature in the mid 70's, which is the perfect climate for relaxing at the beach with a surfboard and ice cream in hand.

+ Although December will provide a few more chiller days during the month than June will, it still manages to climb up to the 70's with the occasional high in the 80's.

+ We have higher collection data for the month June than for December but I'm still confident the surf and ice cream shop will be a big success throughout the year!    

## Summary:

As the data suggest the surf and ice cream shop should go over as a big success in the months of June and December. The temperature changes between the months are minimal with slightly chiller mornings in the December but overall, this will be an exciting venture for us!

Unfortunalely, there could have been some additional data pulled and analyzed to make a more informed decision on the ideal month to open. For example, a query on rain precopatation averages during those months should have been included in the analysis as well as a larger scope on the months throughout the year. So, in closing I still think it clear that the temperature will maintain at an optimal ice cream and surf climate but its unclear how the rain and temperature throughout the remainder of the year will impact us?
